The second Udacity project I've done. The goal is to use some python packages like pandas, numpy and matplotlib to analyze some TMDb movie data, to investigate three questions as follows:
1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2. Which properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
3. Does higher vote score always mean a bigger commercial success?
